Here is a link to a somewhat invalueable resource written by Brad Frost. As a prospective junior developer just learning the ropes, it's great to have this kind of reference around. The website goes on to show many elements and looks that could be useful for your website (i.e. fonts, animations, icons, forms, and much more.) I like that it breaks everything down in clear detail which appeals to an analytical learner like myself.
