The website I'm bookmarking this week is caniuse.com.

Obviously, a common struggle in the development community is compatability for various browsers. Certain browers will accept a type of code where other browsers will bulk at it. As a new developer it's hard to keep all of this straight (although, it's generally a safe bet to blame IE.) CanIUse.com gives you a clear and simple chart to see a certain type of code accross all versions of browsers. This can help someone to plan their code out depending on how it will be seen by the users.
