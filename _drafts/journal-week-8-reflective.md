Our last required journal.

Today we talked about imposter syndrom. I think this is something I definatly experience on a day to day basis. In a nutshell it's all about that feeling that you don't belong. It's a feeling that at any moment someone is going to find out that you aren't who you say you are. That nagging feeling that you really don't know anything at all. 

This can be a daily struggle learning at The Iron Yard. We are learning an entirely new career so quickly that you often stop and wonder if you really know anything at all. Now that I am getting closer to the time of seeking employment I feel like I might not be ready. I wonder if I know enough at all. Is this just the way a career in technology feels? Is it just continual new infomration and challenge? 

According to Dave, yes. He assured us that although we might feel like imposters that we have come a long way and will continue to learn. He also told us we may never feel like experts. It seems like this continual learning can make you feel both uneasy and wonderful. At least it's nice to know that my brain will continue it's daily workout each day of my exciting new career.
