Everything seems to get harder as it gets easier. 

True to form, most of the good progress I've been making lately has made me more overwhelmed. 

See, I like to know a lot of detail around something that I am learning. I want to know why it's important, how it fits with other information I already have, and other details. It's very difficult for me to have a "loose" understand of something. Normally, I ask a lot of questions until finally, I feel like the whole picture is in view. 

At the Iron Yard I have been personally challenged with this learning style. I would image that there are about 15 new topics to grasp each day and then countless details within each. Not only do I not fully understand each topic fully, I am working just to keep the main concepts under control. This has made the learning process pretty challenging for me. 

I have had to find way to adapt to onslaught of information while still keeping my own detailed mind confortable. Here are some of the things I've tried, with varied success

- Taking scupious notes
- 
When information is coming rapid fire, I can hardly even type fast enough, much less understand what we are typing. Later, I have a hard time remembering what we were doing exactly. I found that by quikly, with varied accuracy, I try to jot down what we are covering. Soemtimes, when I'm confused, I just take it down word-for-word just as a reference to have later.

Having a refence in my notes makes me feel better. Although I might not understand or remember what we are going over, I am able to save it somwhere other than my brain. Also, somehow processing the words through my mind and into my fingers helps me retain more. 

This has been pretty helpful but it's not always perfect. I find a number of notes I make are too vague and I'm not sure what I meant or when to use what I wrote down. I hope I can keep getting better at this to at least have a point to google later
    
- Organizing notes

Organization helps my detailed mind understand. I have been combing through those notes I've been making and re-catigorizing. I'm assigning better titles to my notes and putting information together based on subject matter. I am also able to add in additional information to research later. I know I rarely have the time now to learn everything I want to but at least I have a list for later. 

Downloading Evernote helped me to link websites, make my notes easier to read, and build checklists for myself. I'm grateful for having a better tool for my notes.

Organized note taking has helped me to have more traction for my journals, too. I have pages of notes to pull from for tutorial for myself and possibly anyone who needs help. I am working to keep my mind straight when everything can seem chaotic.

- Moving on and making mistakes

When I started at Iron Yard I tended to bull-dog, meaning I would obsess over one project or detail until I went somewhat mad or fell asleep. I would tweek something to as close as perfect as I could and then miss entire other parts of our homework. I had to learn to move on and become less attached to my code. 

Good news is that I've gotten much better at this. I will touch something for a short while and if I cant get it working after some good effort I move on. I know that if I don't have an answer to that particular problem right now but if I walk away I might figure out the answer later. Sometimes a different location or time can help get my mind going. 

I also find that part of this for me is not looking for that "detailed" perfect answer. I may just have to understand it partially and move on for the sake of the entire project. I've been learning more by working this way. I think this is a skill that will continue to benifit me long after this bootcamp is over. 
  
***In conclusion, getting lots of new information every day is hard...and exhausting. I am qucik to feel overwhelmed if I am not careful to monitor my own habits. Simple tactics can help it feel less overwhelming. ***
