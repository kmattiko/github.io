Everything seems to get harder as it gets easier. 

True to form, most of the progress I've been making lately has made me feel all the more overwhelmed. 

See, I like to know a lot of detail around something that I am learning. I want to know why it's important, how it fits with other information I already have, and other details. It's very difficult for me to have a "loose" understand of something. Normally, I ask a lot of questions until finally I feel like the whole picture is in view.  

This has been pretty difficult with my learning style. I would image that there are about 15 new topics to grasp each and every day at The Iron Yard. Not only do I not fully understand each topic fully, I am working just to keep the main concepts under control. This has made our learning process pretty challenging for me. 

I have had to find way to adapt to onslaught of information while still keeping my own detailed mind confortable. Here are some of the things I've tried, with varied success

- Taking scupious notes
  - When information is coming rapid fire, I can hardly even type fast enough, much less understand what we are typing. This can be really challening, expecailly when we come back to the same topic a few days later. I found that by quikly, sometimes as if my fingers were on fire, I type in my notes the main topics we are covering. Soemtimes I just type what David is saying word-for-word so at least the information isn't lost. 
    Having a refence in my notes makes me feel better. Although I might not understand or remember what we are going over, I am able to save it for later. Also, somehow processing the words through my mind and into my fingers helps. 
    This has been pretty helpful but it's not always perfect. I find a number of notes I make are too vague and I'm not sure what I meant or when to use what I wrote down. I hope I can keep getting better at this to at least have a point to google later
    
- Organizing notes-
  - Organization helps my detailed mind understand. I have been combing through those notes I've been making and re-catigorizing. I'm assigning better titles to my notes and putting information together based on subject matter. I am also able to add in additional information I find later. I have been linking in websites I found helpful, things I want to look up, and checklists for myself to get done. 
  This has helped me to have more traction for my journals actually. I have pages of notes to pull from which can help me to write tutorial guides for myelf and peers, if need be. 
  
- Not Bulldogging
  - Bull-dogging is a time when we get obsessed with one aspect of our work and then let hours and hours go by. When I first started out at Iron Yard I had a really hard time not grabbing hold of a project and never letting go. I spent hours tweeking and would miss entire other parts of the assignment. 
  I've gotten much better at this. I will touch something for a short while. If I cant get it working after some good effort I move on. I know that if I don't have an answer to that particular problem right now I might have an answer later. During different parts of the day even, different things will seem harder or easier. 
  I also find that part of this for me is not looking for that "detailed" perfect answer. I may just have to understand it partially and move on for the sake of the entire project. I've been learning more by working this way. I think this is a skill that will continue to benifit me long after this bootcamp is over. 
  
  In conclusion, getting lots of new information every day is hard...and exhausting. I am qucik to feel overwhelmed if I am not careful to monitor my own habits. Simple tactics can help it feel less overwhelming.
