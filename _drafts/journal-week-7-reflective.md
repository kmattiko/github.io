This past weekend we got the opportunity to work on a 6-day project on teams. We also were given the opportunity to lead said team. Sound fun? How about when I tell you leadership changed every one of those days and that our group would struggle to be more diverse than we already were?

I have quite a bit of leadership experience and I have been the leader of many teams, probably nearing 500 different groups of people. This was a skill that I honed over time with much effort. I've learned that personalities have a lot to do with how a team does. If the team is too alike or different it can bring up conflict. But in the past I was always the leader, so it made it easier and more consistent. I didn't act like a "boss" per say but when anything got out of control I was there to step in. I did more facilitating of those groups than actually acting as a manager.

Hence, the biggest challenging in this group project shouldn't have come as a surprise. We had to keep changing the leadership. I am totally comfortable following as much as leading. In fact, I love clear direction given by someone else because the bourdon of decision is not always on my shoulder. But inconsistency and murky communication is very difficult for me. 

In our group I was the third person of three to lead. The first two leaders had different ideas on how we should approach the issue. Our first leader gave us a "whatever you think" approach, which at the time was fine. Each of us were already used to doing individual projects so it was no big deal. Our second leader had strong ideas on how to lead but struggled with communicating the expectations. I found myself trying to follow instruction and complete given tasks only to find out that wasn't really what the leader expected me to complete. By the time it was my turn to lead our group was spinning. 

Too many different leadership styles can cause inconsistent code, frustration with communication, a lack of a future plan, and less work completed. To be honest, my own leadership skills didn't help much at this point. I felt the frustration too. I am used to either being lead by myself or senior management with years of comparable experience. I let personalities and lack of clarity to get under my skin, and a lack of sleep did not help.

Ultimately, our group opted for a more democratic approach over the remaining three days of the project. Rather than having a specific lead we tried to talk as a group. This seemed to help balance everyone out and we accomplished quite a bit of our work in the end. Also, as it often does, talking about our experiences helped. No one had intended to cause trouble for our group, we just had very different approaches to the same problem. 

This was a very valuable learning experience for me personally.
