My reflection for this week is how much I have enjoyed the support and comradery of our particular cohort. 

I was worried about this from the start because team dynamics are important. I have seen first hand, from years of professional training, the way things can go poorly when you have the wrong group of individuals together. I used to see people get obsessed with being competitive, backstabbing, and starting rumors. I have been so pleased that our team at the Iron Yard has not been this way. 

I have been appreciative of all of our respective talents and skills and it really feels like each person has unique skills to share. We are able to ask eachother to find many of the answers to questions that come up. On my most recent project alone, I had a conversation with almost every person on the team. Sean helped me with some API jQuery, Jessy and I talked through curl commands, Michael Stahling gave me some help with CSS, and the examples go on from there. Working on a partner team with Nick was great too. I was happy to find that although he and I are very different, this was a strength for us and not a deterrent. 

It's nice to know that when things get tough, they aren't just that way for you. We are all in the same boat trying to do the best we can.
