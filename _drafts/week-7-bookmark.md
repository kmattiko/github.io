http://codepen.io/

The resource I have bookmarked today is codepen.io. This is a great place where coders, creative folk, and others can get together and share active projects. It provides a framework for a person to create a website or project but without storing it locally. It is a public place where other people who have insterest can visit your project.  It is a good site to use  if you have an idea that you want to see relativly quickly. It also is a place where developers can share ideas and keep in touch with other coders. There are some awesome works just waiting to be shown off.
