Carol Dweck has spent substantial time researching learning mindsets and how they impact the world around us. She has coined the "Growth vs. Fixed Mindset" which sheds light on how we are trained as learners from a very early age. This information is pertinent not only to school aged children but can also be influential for adults as well. By understanding these basic principles we can help ourselves and others feel more fulfilled when they are faced with new challenges.
We've probably all heard a compliment over the years along the lines of "You are so smart" or "Your a natural at that". We have come to often think of these types of comments as really positive and are saught after. People often fish for these types of comments because they want to feel as though they are somehow different from the rest, or set apart. The issue with these types of comments is that rarely do things actually come "natually." How often has something just fallen in your lap with minimal effort? It also tends to sets us up for failure when things do not just "fall into place." If you tell me I'm a natural today and then tomorrow I struggle, amd I a different person? It can cause some people to feel a sort of personal shortcoming and can stunt the learning process. An example of this for me came when I started my corporate facilitation career. I was surrounded by extroverted people, excited chattering in our Facilitation 101 class. THe instructor very clearly laid out that being "boisterous and carismatic" were the way to be succesfull in that career. I, as an introverted and more technically minded person felt instantly put off. What if this wasn't the right job for me or I didn't have the right "inherent skill set." It turned out I had the talents necessary, but if I had only listened to that one instructor I may have never continued down the path I took out of fear I wasn't good enough in some way. 
Growth Mindset, on the other hand, sets us up for better success. It encourages us to believe that skills are earned, not just given at random. For me this feels very refreshing because the world is yours to take! If you want to be excellent at something it is within your reach, you just have to work very hard to get there. It might take time and some agony, but the world is within your reach. This is a great equalizer because it gives anyone with enough motivation to be whatever they want to be regardless of preconcieved notions. 
The experience of Iron Yard is a very challenging one. THis is a great time to apply the benifits of the Growth Mindset over the Fixed Mindset. People may have certain ideas about code schools, women in technology, skills required, and abilities to apply learning. My own brother, for instance...



1. Introduction- 
  * Basic breakdown of the concepts behind growth/fixed mindset
  * The importance of implimenting a learning growth mindset
2. Fixed Mindset
  * Define the fixed mindset, praise given for inherent talent and skills
  * Where issues lie with this mindset
  * Example from becoming a trainer, Rodger "you are too introverted to succeed in this type of role" leading to insecurities of not having the right "talents"
3. Growth Mindset
  * Define Growth Mindset
  * How we can appreciate learning, we are responsible for shown efforts
4. Conclusion
  * Joining Iron Yard, negative/skeptical recpetion from my brother
  * Ability to apply a growth mindset, "I can do what I put my mind to" energy
  * Effectiveness of slowly and reliably putting one foot in front of the next
