I became pretty thoughtful tonight about my inherent struggle with procrastination. It's kinda a long story but it will have a point. 

Today, I got home from Iron Yard, full of information, new ideas, energy, and (of course) a ton of homework. I was especially excited because I had the house to myself, which is pretty rare. It was a great time to dive into coding. However, the moment I stepped in the apartment I saw a million things that needed to be cleaned, put away, and done. So instead of starting with the homework, I began to clean. When I started to see a general sparkle I stopped to sit at the computer. But as soon as I loaded the GitHub page I remembered some knitting I'd put off. 

A couple years ago my cousin knit me a beautifully intriquite afgan blanket. She must have spent so much time on the colors and patterns, it boggles my mind. Somewhat unfortunatly, I also have cats...rambuncious cats...ones that run around the house at 4am like they are on fire. As you might guess, the afgan got a hole in it and started to unravel from the middle. And although this happened a few months ago I hadn't found time to fix it. 

This comes back to me and my friend, procrastination. I knew there was a hole, I knew I could do something to fix it, I didn't even believe it would take too long, but I still didn't move forward. What stopped me was that I wasn't confident on how exactly I would start. Thinking over all the details made this very small problem seem more difficult. 

So tonight, because I was also procrastinating homework. I chose to fix the blanket, and get it off my mind. I started by looking online for simple patterns, not really sure what I needed. By using some of my new aquired "mad-googling-skills", I found a circular knitting pattern and got started. That didn't work. I'd forgotten how hard it is to knit in a circle. So I pulled it apart and started over, this time crocetting. I found a different pattern and it was much easier. But again, this pattern wasn't turning out exactly right. I started over, a third time, and relied on some of my own instict and memory coming back. I wasted time making mistakes but I learned something each time I tried and failed. I got a little frusterated but I also had a pretty good patch to show for my work. 

I took my pretty little patch over to the blanket. Only then did I realize that the blanket had a "line" shapped hole, which was not circular at all. I had totally put my cart before the horse here. I made some wild assumption that I knew what the end product needed to be before I had actually planned anything out. I was settled with a new drink coaster and the same hole in my blanket. 

Luckly, the line-shaped hole was easer to fix and patch. I started to crocett directly on the blanket, choosing the strongest sections of blanket that hadn't yet unraveled. My mind kept going back to coding and I even started to think of original loops as some sort of "parent element." I also needed to make sure what I was building was structurally sound, and could hold up to my crazy household. I planned out how many rows I would eventually need to make to hold it together. I paid attention to detail and worked carefully to make sure I didn't make silly errors. Somehow, all of these things seemed so related to constructing a website. 

I continued to make corrilations to our cohort projects. The blanket was a creative project someone else built with their own pattern and style. This is a lot like what we have been doing when working through the Blueprint projects. We have to add our own style to existing code and still make it work with the original structure. And, I wanted the blanket to be structurally sound and as visually appealing as possible. My code doesn't always look beautiful either, which can be discouraging, but I try to make it functional and still stylish. 

Perhaps one of my biggest take-aways was how long I had let this blanket project go on. The hole got bigger and bigger which weighed on my mind more and more. I knew it needed to be cared for but the solution got complicated in my mind. The better choice would have been to do some planning, and I see that now. I want to make sure not to let complex coding projects intimidate me. I admire many of those in my cohort that "try anything." Sure it might not get them the perfect results but they figure it out by making attempts. Once I have some sort of plan it's good to make some attempts, fail, work-through it, and try again. 

So, I used this procrastination to grog some important information about my own internal processes. I hope it helps me to keep the next complicated process in perspective.
