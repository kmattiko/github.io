**Week 2 at The Iron Yard**

I can certainly feel the cohort start to get into the meat and potatos of the material after week 2 with the Iron Yard. Week one got a little hairy but now it seems easy compaired to what we are getting into in our second week. We are covering topics even more quickly and new tools are introduced every day. I have a tendancy to struggle with the vocabulary of all of the tools David introduces so I've started to make note card. I feel good about getting slightly faster at the command line by making additional cheat sheets and of course, by practicing the heck out of it! I may not be using all of the keyboard commands quite yet, but I figure it is better to get used to everything at my own pace. 

Javascript is not a new concept this week but it is still by far the most difficult for me to full grasp. At least I'm starting to get some of the more basics tasks such as adding event listeners, using tracer bullets, functions, and using specific portions of the document. However, I seem to be getting most confused about _when_ I need to use each concept. This week I've struggled more with where to even begin when writing the code. Once everything is planned out, the plan can seem somewhat overwhelming. I don't want to get stuck in "perfectionist procrationation" as Dave calls it. I guess I just want some magical formula that will tie all of the loose pieces in my mind, together. But, like with anything, there are many ways to approach the same project. I plan to piece together what I can, how ever I can, and hope I know how to make more sense of the mess later.

We have gone through the material pretty darn fast. It is a lot of information to master in such a short amount of time. I keep thinking back to the classes I used to train, which lasted 6 weeks. Those 6 weeks always flew by so fast and the learning was supposed to be "completed." I worry sometimes that this time at Iron Yard will seems just as fast when everything is said and done. I am really trying to push myself to be as attentive and obsorbant as I can in the short time I am here to learn. I know it will be over sooner than I'd like...
