**Week 2 at The Iron Yard**

I can certainly feel the cohort start to get into the meat and potatos of the material after week 2 with the Iron Yard. Week one seemed somewhat difficult but it was easy compaired to what we are getting into know now. We've gone through a lot of new topics but we have also spent time expanding on topics introcduced from week one. I am getting faster at things like the command line and have taken time to make a sort of "cheat-sheet" for myself to use when working on this. I don't have to think as hard about what the right command is going to be around git or terminal. 

Javascript is not a new concept this week but it is probably still by far the most difficult to truly understand. I am starting to get some of the basics around event listeners, using tracer bullets, functions, and using specific portions of the document. However, I seem to be getting most confused about _when_ I need to use each concept. This week I've struggled more with knowing where to even begin with the code to make anything work. I think I want some magical formula handed to me that will tell me what goes where but I'm starting to think this doesn't exist. It seems like there are many ways to approach the same project. I am going to encourage myself to just try things out more easier, jsut to see what happens. 

We have gone through the material pretty quickly at Iron Yard. I know we need to do this because we have limited time to learn and so it makes sense that I need to just work harder. I have found it especially challenging in the afternoons after a long morning discussion. My mind seems to think it's done for the day and struggles to apply new concepts. This just won't do though., we have homework due and afternoond discussions that I can't afford to miss. Lately, when this happens I try to have an internal dialoge to tell myself to keep engaged. If I make a concentrated effort to apply some of my knowledge I feel as though it is a small victory.
