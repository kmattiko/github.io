1. Built-in objects
  * Null -  This is an empty value, nothing is there to represent. The system cannot find what you are looking for (i.e. var test = x + 2; console.log sample(5))
  * Boolean - True and False values (i.e. 5 + 3 = 8// true)
  * Number - An intiger representing value (i.e. 8)
  * String - A phrase or set of letters strung together, can be added to a bigger message posted to console (i.e."Hello World")
  * Infinity - A numeric representation of the word infinity, which is to say an endless number representing unlimited   potential. JS recognizes this as negative or positive infinity.(i.e. 8 * Infinity = Infinity)
  * NaN - This is not a number. It could represent that a math equasion fails and no number is available or it could be a different kind of non-numeric value. (i.e. 8 + "Hello" = NaN)
  * Undefined - This can be when you don't pass your formula a value to work out, JS is waiting for some sort of definition. (i.e. 8 + x = i)
2. Arithmetic Operators
  * + - Adds numbers together to get value (3 + 5 = 8)
  * - - Subtracts one number from another and produces a remainder (8 - 5 = 3)
  * * - Multiplies, which is to take the value of one number and expand it the number of times of the other number (3 * 5 = 15)
  * / - Divides, which separates one number by another (15 / 3 = 5)
  * % - Gives the number left over after division has occured (15 % 8 = 7)
3. Comparison Operators
  * >= - Greater or equal (8 >= 5)
  * < - Less than (5 < 8)
  * != - Not equal to (8 != 5)
4. Statements and Declarations
  *  Var - Makes a variable (or identifier) which can be set to rules. Can be started with letters, $, or (_). (i.e. var hiHello = x)
