**Here is the start of a list of topics I can expand upon later***

 MVC- what this stands for, how it works, and how our projects will often be organized
 
 Time management tools- how to use things like _Trello_ or other planning tools to make the best use of my time
 
 CSS- Our work in making things look right and fit on the page, I've loved this so far! 
 
 Using the Bower Components- All the new tools, how to use them, how to find them and what they do :)
 
 Calling tags from HTML- I hope this starts getting clearer in the future
 
 Block-module - what this is really made of to structure things in CSS
