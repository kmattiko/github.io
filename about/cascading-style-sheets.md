**Display: None**

generally used when something is being shown and hidden in JavaScript but without deleting the item completely.  It is also used for the specialized elements such as ````script````

**Block Display**

Commonly used for div, p, and form elements. This display will stretches out a new line across the screen. It can also be used for header, footer, and section elements. 

 **Inline Display**

This display will wrap your text to fit inside a paragraph like format. It is commonly used with a span element or a element, since it is used for hyperlinks.

**Width**

Gives parameters  to elements so they do not stretch the full length of the page. This can be in the form of relative and absolute lengths. 

**Margin**

This is how much space goes between one element and another. If margin: 0 auto is given then the text will be centered in the middle of the element. 

**Box Sizing**

This is a fancier ability of CSS which will allow the designer to use widths, margins, and borders without the box size increasing past the set width. Before Box Sizing, the size of the assigned width would increase when padding was given. The–webkit—and –moz—prefixes are often added to box sizing. 

**Static Position**

This value is similar to saying, there is no positioning relative to anything else. The element is put in the center of the page and will not relate to the elements around it

**Relative Position**

This will allow you to give an element extra data to make move it relative to other elements on the page. 

**Fixed Position**

This will make an element stay where it is placed on the page, even if the user scrolls the page. This might be used to keep a menu always present at the top of the screen for example. 

**Float**

This is used to fit two elements together and get the text of one to wrap around the shape of the other. 

**Font**

Used to change the font style, size, and weight. It can also change the family in which the fonts exist such as Sans-Serif vs Sans. It can be applied to :first letter or :first line to change the font just for a specific part of the document/paragraph. 

**Text**

The start of text can be followed by many variations including align, decoration, orientation, overflow, and transform (to name a few). This moves the actual words around and gives them certian decorations or commands on where the words should go. 

**Line**

Line-height refers to the height of line boxes within the element. See [MDN Reference](herehttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height)
