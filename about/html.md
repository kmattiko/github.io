*Tag Structure*

*Non-Word Tag Characters*

`<ul>` and `<ol>`

`<dl>` 

Stands for Description List. This can be used to store key-value pairs (such as object literals?) or to list a glossary on the page. `<dl>s` are parents to `<dt>s` (used for keys) and `<dd>s` (used for values).

`<fieldset>`

`<legend>`

`<input>`

Takes user data in a variety of ways. Some ways include...
