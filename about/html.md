*Tag Structure*

*Non-Word Tag Characters*

`<ul>` and `<ol>` 
  
  These are holders for list items. `<ul>s` are unordered lists and <ol>s are ordered lists, that will be numbered. These elements have `<li>s` as children, which will create the actual list. 

`<dl>` 

Stands for Description List. This can be used to store key-value pairs (such as object literals?) or to list a glossary on the page. `<dl>s` are parents to `<dt>s` (used for keys) and `<dd>s` (used for values).

`<form>`

Form will take user input and send it to the server. You are able to use the :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes with forms. It is also possible to add AutoCapitialize and AutoFill to this element, helping the user have more consistant inputs. It's children can include `<label>` `<input>` `<fieldset>`.

`<fieldset>`

This can group different `<label>` elements together. It's attributes include disabled, form, and name. 

`<legend>`

A child of `<fieldset>` 

`<input>`

Takes user data in a variety of ways. Some ways include date, color, password, and email, just to name a few. Values can be AutoCorrected and formatted to help the user input relevent information. 

`<label>`

`<button>`

`<select>`

`<option>`

`<textarea>`
