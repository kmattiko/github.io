***FIRST WEEK AT THE IRON YARD***

**Learning the terminal**

One of the more impressive and exciting things I have started to pick up is working on the command line in the terminal of the computer. Doing this helps me to feel in control of my actions and to get closer wtih how my computer operates on a basic level. I still struggle with some of the keys and the speed portion of using the terminal but I intend to work with it extensively each day to improve my skill.

**Learning JavaScript Basics**

JavaScript so far, is a complex yet dynamic language full of quirks. Just putting the basic actions together can get difficult fast but has instant gratifying results. I feel that although learning JavaScript is it's own challenge, learning how to test our code is almost as challenging. 

**Github Introduction**

Github and Git commands are at the center of what we do when working with code. A large portion of the first week was dedicated to understanding the open-source code community and learning how to pull, push, branch, and commit our way around. The terminology can be daughting at first but with practice, espcially through the terminal mentioned above, it has gotten easier.

**Cohort Styles**

Working in a team has been a satifying experience. I feel very privledged to be among such excellent and interesting individuals. It is nice to know that we are in this boat together. I have felt a genuine team spirit and a willingness to help eachother from day one. 

**New Career Path**

Something I hadn't realized when joining Iron Yard was the weekly career development sessions each Friday. Having some sort of visitor or speaker is great in getting to know the community around us. I am impressed with the encouragement we have recieved all around to go to Meet-ups, get involved, and connect to the code community. Dave expecially has been helpful in giving a realistic look into what it takes to make this type of career change and some of what can be expected in the future. I look forward to getting the chance to be a part of the Front-End Conference in Tampa because opportunities such as that can really help us to build our own personal brands.
